## Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures

* Closures, a function-like construct you can store in a variable
* Iterators, a way of processing a series of elements
* How to use these two features to improve the I/O project in Chapter 12
* The performance of these two features (Spoiler alert: they’re faster than you might think!)

### Closures: Anonymous Functions that Can Capture Their Environment

Anonymous functions that can receive arguments, and be passed on as arguments to other functions.

### Creating an Abstraction of Behavior with Closures

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity: u32) -> u32 {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    intensity
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let simulated_user_specified_value = 10;
    let simulated_random_number = 7;

    generate_workout(
        simulated_user_specified_value,
        simulated_random_number
    );
}
```

```rust
fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
    if intensity < 25 {
        println!(
            "Today, do {} pushups!",
            simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
        );
        println!(
            "Next, do {} situps!",
            simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
        );
    } else {
        if random_number == 3 {
            println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
        } else {
            println!(
                "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
            );
        }
    }
}
```

See `example01.rs`.

### Refactoring Using Functions

```rust
fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
    let expensive_result =
        simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity);

    if intensity < 25 {
        println!(
            "Today, do {} pushups!",
            expensive_result
        );
        println!(
            "Next, do {} situps!",
            expensive_result
        );
    } else {
        if random_number == 3 {
            println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
        } else {
            println!(
                "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                expensive_result
            );
        }
    }
}
```

See `example02.rs`.

### Refactoring with Closures to Store Code

```rust
let expensive_closure = |num| {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
}
```


```rust
fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
    let expensive_closure = |num| {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    };

    if intensity < 25 {
        println!(
            "Today, do {} pushups!",
            expensive_closure(intensity)
        );
        println!(
            "Next, do {} situps!",
            expensive_closure(intensity)
        );
    } else {
        if random_number == 3 {
            println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
        } else {
            println!(
                "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                expensive_closure(intensity)
            );
        }
    }
}
```

See `example03.rs`.

### Closure Type Inference and Annotation

```rust
let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
};
```

```rust
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
```

```rust
let example_closure = |x| x;

let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
let n = example_closure(5);
```

The type of `x` is inferred by the compiler to be `String` based on its first usage (during COMPILE TIME), soon:

```rust
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs
  |
  | let n = example_closure(5);
  |                         ^ expected struct `std::string::String`, found
  integral variable
  |
  = note: expected type `std::string::String`
             found type `{integer}`
```

### Storing Closures Using Generic Parameters and the Fn Traits

```rust
struct Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32
{
    calculation: T,
    value: Option<u32>,
}
```

```rust
impl<T> Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32
{
    fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {
        Cacher {
            calculation,
            value: None,
        }
    }

    fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
        match self.value {
            Some(v) => v,
            None => {
                let v = (self.calculation)(arg);
                self.value = Some(v);
                v
            },
        }
    }
}
```

```rust
fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
    let mut expensive_result = Cacher::new(|num| {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    });

    if intensity < 25 {
        println!(
            "Today, do {} pushups!",
            expensive_result.value(intensity)
        );
        println!(
            "Next, do {} situps!",
            expensive_result.value(intensity)
        );
    } else {
        if random_number == 3 {
            println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
        } else {
            println!(
                "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                expensive_result.value(intensity)
            );
        }
    }
}
```

See `example04.rs`.

### Limitations of the Cacher Implementation

```rust
#[test]
fn call_with_different_values() {
    let mut c = Cacher::new(|a| a);

    let v1 = c.value(1);
    let v2 = c.value(2);

    assert_eq!(v2, 2);
}
```

```
thread 'call_with_different_values' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `1`,
 right: `2`', src/main.rs
```

### Capturing the Environment with Closures

In the workout generator example, we only used closures as inline anonymous functions. However, closures have an additional capability that functions don’t have: they can capture their environment and access variables from the scope in which they’re defined.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 4;

    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;

    let y = 4;

    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

```
error[E0434]: can't capture dynamic environment in a fn item; use the || { ...
} closure form instead
 --> src/main.rs
  |
4 |     fn equal_to_x(z: i32) -> bool { z == x }
  |
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;

    println!("can't use x here: {:?}", x);

    let y = vec![1, 2, 3];

    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

```
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
 --> src/main.rs:6:40
  |
4 |     let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;
  |                      -------- value moved (into closure) here
5 |
6 |     println!("can't use x here: {:?}", x);
  |                                        ^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `x` has type `std::vec::Vec<i32>`, which does not
  implement the `Copy` trait
```
